<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Everybody Eats is an application designed to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically in solving world hunger (SDG 2). The app connects restaurants, cafes, and diners with leftover food to social organizations such as orphanages and charities. By sharing consumable surplus food with those in need, Everybody Eats helps reduce hunger while minimizing food waste. Through this effort, we support global goals to end hunger, enhance food security, and promote environmental sustainability.
